		<h2>My Story</h2>
		<p> I come from a family of five, with two brothers. I was raised in a smaller town in Northern Michigan called Traverse City. Traverse City is consistently rated as one of the most beatiful places in America. It is an ideal place to do anything on the water like Fly Fishing, boating or kayaking.  </p>
